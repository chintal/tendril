The Log Utils Module (:mod:`tendril.utils.log`)
===============================================

This module provides utilities to deal with logging systems. The intent of
having this module instead of using :mod:`logging` directly is to allow the
injection of various default parameters and options into all the loggers
used from a central place, instead of littering them throughout the
modules.

At present, this module does nothing that is overly useful, except for
being able to set the default log level for all modules simultaneously.

.. rubric:: Usage Example

>>> from tendril.utils import log
>>> logger = log.get_logger(__name__, log.DEFAULT)

"""

from logging import DEBUG   # noqa
#: Level for informational entires. Low volume

#: Warnings only, which inform of possible failure
from logging import WARNING  # noqa
#: Errors only, which inform of high likelihood of failure
from logging import ERROR  # noqa
#: Critical Errors, things which should halt execution entirely
