The Utils Package (:mod:`tendril.utils`)
========================================

The :mod:`utils` package contains various Utils modules which provide
functionality that is either :

- Logically independent of the main Tendril functionality.
- Used by multiple Tendril's packages, either due to generic nature of the
  functionality, or because it defines the structure that functionality should
  take within Tendril.

These modules typically expose specific functionality of third-party or
built-in Python modules and simplify access by restricting the ways in which
these modules can be used. For instance, various options are preselected
within the Utils module, meaning application code does not have to bother
about it. This comes at the cost of reducing the flexibility available when
using this functionality in application code.

The intent of the :mod:`tendril.utils` package and it's modules is to attempt
to create a consistent structure throughout the :mod:`tendril` codebase. The
:mod:`tendril.utils` module, in effect, specifies the preferred way to do
certain common things. Tendril application code which makes use of the
functionality of this module is expected to benefit in the form of
consistency, relative ease in honoring user-provided parameters (across the
codebase), and not need to deal with the underlying libraries and the wide
range of usage options available for the most common cases.

It is expected that this structure will be critical to being able to easily
adapt the Tendril codebase to new environments and for making more flexibility
accessible to administrators of Tendril instances.

Many of the modules provided here can be re-implemented to use different
underlying implementations, while preserving the interface they present to
Tendril application code.

.. warning:: It is possible that this approach will soon reach the point of
             diminishing returns.
